## This is a project template

If starting a backend node project with [koa](https://koajs.com), consider
either use this template directly or just grab some inspiration.

## knex rocks!

knex will help you to build your queries and that's it, no ORM, M-N relations,
nothing. it does only one thing and does it well.

## containers, images, registries and so on

at some point container images became the de-facto standard for application
publishing and there is no way back from there.

but this is not a bad thing, once you figure out that good practices still
mostly the same.
